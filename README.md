Dotfiles
========

This repo is heavily based off michaeljsmalley's dotfiles repo which you can
find [HERE](https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles).

This repo includes all of my custom dotfiles.

The setup script backs up your existing dotfiles into a `dotfiles_old/`
directory if you already have any dotfiles of the same name as the dotfile
symlinks being created in your home directory.

Installation
------------

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/lookupatnight/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./symlinks.sh
```
